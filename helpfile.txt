If you selected -e the integer will be taken as a number of minutes and converted to a number of words based on your user conversion rate.
If you have not selected a conversion rate, you will be prompted to do so.
To delete an entry, enter you username and then -n. Your log will be displayed and you will be prompted to enter the index of the entry you would like to drop. The entry chosen will then be deleted
